MyScreen
========

Overview
--------

MyScreen is a free project released under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (GPL). It is based on
[GNU/Screen](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen), a full-screen
window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several
processes.

MyScreen includes a configuration of GNU/Screen window manager with a
system status notifications and several statistics.

Why using MyScreen
----------------

MyScreen presents the same advantages than GNU/Screen. For instance, you
can open several terminals with one screen session, if you do not have X
or if you use ssh.

Furthermore, you can see immediately your system state :

- Number of users connected
- Uptime
- Network rates (download/upload)
- Battery average
- Wifi quality
- Loadaverage
- Number of processes
- CPU percentages (global + per core)
- Disks access (I/O) percentages
- Disks use (capacity)
- Memory consumed
- Swap consumed
