Why use MyScreen
================

GNU/Screen
----------

MyScreen presents the same advantages than GNU/Screen. For instance, you
can open several terminals with one screen session, if you do not have X
or if you use a ssh connection.

Furthermore, if you work in a GNU/Screen session, you can
detach/reattach your session from/to a terminal. You can open several
tabs and get them back from a ssh connection for example.

So, in X mode, you do not need to open several terminal emulator
windows, and you can keep your session if X crashes.
